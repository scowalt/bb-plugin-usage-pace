bb's usage card shows how much of each quota window you used, and when it
resets. It does not show if your rate lasts until then. With 42% used and five
days to go, are you fine or not? Usage Pace answers that in the same card.

## What you get

- **A tick at even pace.** Each bar gets a tick where the bar would be if you
  used the quota at an exact even rate over the window.
- **The difference in colour.** The part of the bar past the tick is red: that
  is how far ahead of pace you are. When you are under pace, the free part up
  to the tick is light grey.
- **The numbers on hover.** Hover a row to see two lines under the dates, for
  example "17% ahead of pace (1d 5h)" and "runs out Sat 23:05 · 2d 16h
  without quota". When the rate lasts, the second line shows the budget that
  lasts to the reset, per day or per hour, or in the last three hours what is
  left.
- **The same on a touch screen.** Tap a row to show the lines. Tap again to
  hide them.
- **Grok Build in the card.** bb's Grok provider reports no usage. Usage
  Pace adds a Grok Build tab with the weekly or monthly credits and their
  pace.
- **Which provider failed.** When one provider fails, bb shows "Couldn't
  refresh usage" on every tab. Usage Pace shows it only on the failed
  provider's tab, with that provider's error, and puts a red dot on that
  tab. You can dismiss the message until the failure changes.
- **Fewer tabs.** bb lists some providers, such as Cursor, on every
  machine. A setting hides the tabs you do not use.
- **Compact footer rows.** The optional strip shows one row per provider account:
  provider icon, pace-status glyph, weekly/session usage, and a countdown to
  the earliest projected run-out. Hover for pace details; click for the dialog
  and token totals. Unknown or stale pace is a dash, with no countdown.
- **Codex banked resets in the footer.** The optional strip adds a `↺ 3`
  badge with the saved-reset count, earliest-expiry tooltip, and an amber
  warning within seven days of expiry. Click for read-only reset details;
  banked resets do not alter the pace calculation.
- **`bb usage-pace`** prints each window with its pace in a terminal, and
  `--json` gives agents a `pace` object for each window.

## How pace is calculated

Providers report the used percent and the reset time of each window. The
window length comes from its label ("Five-hour limit", "Weekly limit"). A
window without a length in its label takes the length of a window that resets
at the same time. The start of the window is the reset time minus the length.
The plugin then projects the current rate in a straight line to the reset.

Nights and weekends usually lower the real rate, so the projection is a
warning, not a forecast. "Too early to judge pace" applies only while both
elapsed time and quota used are below 5%. Significant early usage still warns;
unknown pace never claims to last until reset.

## Requirements and data

The plugin reads the data that bb's built-in Provider usage card already has,
from that card's cache, so it adds no provider requests. It only adds
elements to bb's card. If a bb update changes the card, the tick and the
lines stop showing, and nothing else breaks.

The Codex banked-reset badge and dialog make separate read-only inventory
requests on the selected host using its local ChatGPT login. This private
Codex endpoint may be unavailable; an unknown balance is never shown as zero.
No resets are automatically or interactively redeemed by this preview.

For Grok Build, it registers a companion provider, "Grok Build (usage)", so
bb's provider picker shows it next to bb's own "Grok Build". It reads the
Grok CLI login from `grok login` and asks xAI's billing service for the
credit window. A setting turns this off.

Usage Pace is a fork of Usage Bar by Dmitrii Kapustin (MIT). The optional
Usage Bar footer strip is still in the plugin, off by default. The Grok Build
usage comes from Grok Build Usage by MacHatter1 (MIT).
