Tells you if the current burn rate lasts until each quota window resets. If the rate does not last, it tells you when the quota runs out and how long you will be without quota.

This fork of [Usage Pace by Charles Lee](https://github.com/chug2k/bb-plugin-usage-pace) adds read-only Codex banked-reset details and a sidebar badge.

Originally a fork of [Usage Bar](https://github.com/dmitriikapustin/bb-plugins-by-kapustin/tree/main/plugins/usage-bar) by Dmitrii Kapustin (MIT). The pace calculation and the usage-card integration are new. The optional footer strip, the dialog, the token totals and the CLI come from Usage Bar. The Grok Build usage comes from [Grok Build Usage](https://github.com/MacHatter1/bb-plugin-grok-build-usage) by MacHatter1 (MIT).

## What it shows

**In bb's usage card** (the built-in Provider usage card in the sidebar footer):

- Each window's bar gets a tick at **even pace**: where the bar would be if you used the quota at an exact even rate.
- The part of the bar between the fill and the tick shows the difference. It is **red** when you are ahead of pace, and light grey (headroom) when you are under pace.
- Hover a row to see the delta under the dates. The row stays open while the pointer is anywhere in the list of rows, so moving between rows does not flicker. On a touch screen (or with the keyboard), tap the row: bb expands it, and the delta shows under bb's reset time:

```
7d    [█████████|██········]  44%   5d 2h
               17% ahead of pace (1d 4h)
        runs out Sun 00:03 · 2d 15h without quota
```

The first line is the difference from even pace, in percentage points and in time. The second line is the time without quota before the reset, or the daily budget that lasts.

The card belongs to another plugin. Usage Pace only adds nodes to it, and reads the card's own data (`provider-usage` `getUsage`, from its cache), so the labels always match. If a bb update changes the card's markup, the tick and the delta stop showing, and nothing else breaks.

**Optional footer strip.** Turn on *Also show the Usage Pace strip* in the plugin settings. It shows one chip for each provider account (the weekly window):

```
✳ 44% 1.6× · 2d 15h short
```

- `44%`: the used percent.
- `1.6×`: the pace. The used percent divided by the share of the window that has passed. `1.0×` is even pace.
- `2d 15h short`: at this rate, the quota runs out 2d 15h before the reset. If the rate lasts, the chip shows the time to the reset.

The colour changes to warning when the projection is above 85%, and to critical when it is above 100%. The Usage Bar thresholds (80% and 95% used) also stay.

**Codex banked resets.** The Codex chip also shows `↺ 3` for three banked resets. Hover for the earliest reported expiration; the badge turns amber when a reset expires within seven days. Click the badge to open and focus that account's reset details. `↺ 0` is dimmed, `↺ …` is loading, and `↺ ?` means unavailable or expired-since-read data—not zero.

This is read-only: opening details never redeems a reset. Banked resets do not change quota percentages or pace calculations. The footer and dialog share one inventory, refreshed every five minutes while visible, on focus, or with the dialog's refresh button. Reads run on the corresponding Codex host using its local ChatGPT login and a private Codex inventory endpoint; availability may vary. Counts are provider-reported and details may be incomplete.

**Dialog.** Click the strip to open it. Each window shows a bar with a mark at even pace, the rate details, and the result:

```
Weekly limit                    resets in 5d 2h   44%
[██████████████|·······················]
1.6× pace · on track for 161%           2d 15h without quota
· budget 11%/day                   runs out Sun 27 Sep, 00:03
```

`budget` is the rate per day (or per hour, for windows shorter than two days) that lasts exactly until the reset.

## How pace is calculated

Providers report only `usedPercent` and `resetsAt` for each window. The window length comes from the label: `5h`, `7d`, `Weekly`, `5-hour window`, or `session` (5 hours). A window with no length in its label, for example `Fable`, takes the length of a window that resets at the same time. Then:

- start of window = reset − length
- pace = used ÷ (elapsed ÷ length)
- runs out = now + elapsed × (100 − used) ÷ used, if that is before the reset
- time without quota = reset − runs out

A monthly window ("Monthly credits") starts one calendar month before its reset.

This is a straight-line projection. Nights and weekends usually lower the real rate. In the first 5% of a window, the plugin shows "too early to judge pace" and no projection.

## Which provider failed

When one provider on a machine fails to refresh, bb's card shows "Couldn't refresh usage. Showing the last available update." on every tab, and does not say which provider failed. Usage Pace moves the message to the tab of the provider that failed:

- That tab gets a red dot, and shows bb's message with the provider's error, for example "opencode: OpenCode Go usage access was denied.".
- The other tabs, whose data is current, show no message.
- When the failed provider is not known, the message shows on every tab, as bb shows it.

The × dismisses the message until a different provider fails or the error changes.

## Hide providers in the card

bb lists some providers on every machine, installed or not. Cursor is one of them. Set *Hide these providers in bb's usage card* to a comma-separated list of names as the card shows them, for example `Cursor`. The provider picker still lists them.

```sh
bb plugin config usage-pace set hiddenCardProviders "Cursor"
```

## Grok Build

bb runs Grok Build through its built-in ACP provider (`acp-grok`), and that provider reports no usage, so bb's usage card has no Grok tab. Usage Pace adds one:

- It registers a companion provider, `usage-pace-grok` ("Grok Build (usage)"), listed only on hosts where the `grok` command is installed. It runs the same Grok Build agent, and it also answers bb's usage request: it reads the Grok CLI login (`~/.grok/auth.json`, made by `grok login`) and asks xAI's billing service (`cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`) for the credit window and its reset.
- It serves bb's `provider-usage.v1` source contract for that provider, so the card shows a Grok Build tab. The tab gets the tick, the band and the hover lines like every other tab.

Because the companion is a full provider, bb's provider picker shows it next to bb's own "Grok Build". Threads on either one run the same agent.

Turn this off with the *Add Grok Build usage to bb's usage card* setting, then reload the plugin. Do not also install Grok Build Usage: both plugins then add a Grok tab.

## Install

```sh
bb plugin install 'git:https://github.com/scowalt/bb-plugin-usage-pace.git@v0.3.0'
# Enable the footer strip (off by default) to see the Codex banked-reset badge:
bb plugin config usage-pace set showStrip true
```

Use `@^0.3.0` instead of `@v0.3.0` to track compatible releases with `bb plugin update usage-pace`. Release tags include prebuilt server, frontend, and host bundles; no local SDK or build tooling is needed for a Git install. Sign into Codex with a ChatGPT account on each host where you want banked-reset inventory.

From a local checkout:

```sh
bb plugin install ./
```

If you turn on the strip, do not also install Usage Bar. Both plugins put a strip in the same footer. With the Grok setting on (the default), do not also install Grok Build Usage.

## From the terminal

```sh
bb usage-pace              # weekly windows, with pace
bb usage-pace --all        # every window
bb usage-pace --json       # each window has a `pace` object
bb usage-pace --tokens     # token totals across BB
```

```
Claude Code · Max (5x) (MacBook Pro)
  Weekly limit        44%  resets in 5d 2h
                     runs out Sun 00:03, 2d 15h before reset · 1.6× pace · on track for 161% · budget 11%/day
```

## Requirements

bb **0.44.0+** with bundled Plugin SDK **0.5.29+**. The plugin uses the provider authentication that bb already has. Only providers and hosts that report quota information appear. Token totals are not billing data.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run check   # tsc
bun run test    # vitest (pace, reset badge/UI) + node:test (token totals)
bun run build   # bb plugin build
bun run check:release # metadata/digest and isolated bundle smoke test; no provider requests
bb plugin reload usage-pace
```

Before a release, update the version in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`, run the checks and build, and commit the generated `dist/` bundles alongside their sources. Every artifact's `pluginVersion` must match the package version. Create a new `vX.Y.Z` tag; never move a published tag.
